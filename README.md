# MazeSolver

This is an implementation of a basic maze solver.

The Maze class creates a rectangular maze with a start point, finish point, and obstacles along the way. The maze constitutes squares created by the Square class. The search algorithm is based on both Breadth First Search (makes use of the QueueWorklist class) and Depth First Search (makes use of the StackWorklist Class). Using BFS and DFS, the algorithm solves any given maze and returns the solution in the form of a string.
